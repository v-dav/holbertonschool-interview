## 🧐 Project Overview
Welcome to the Minimum Operations algorithm project! In this task, you'll be working with a text file containing a single character 'H'. Your text editor has only two operations: Copy All and Paste. The goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' 'H' characters in the file, optimizing memory usage.

## Task Description



```python
def minOperations(n)
```

- Returns an integer.
- If 'n' is impossible to achieve, return 0.

### Example:

For `n = 9`:

```
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
```

Number of operations: 6
