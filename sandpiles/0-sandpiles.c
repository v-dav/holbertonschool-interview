 * sandpiles_sum - Computes sum of two 3x3 stable sandpiles
 * Description: We assume that grid1 and grid2 are stable
 * (none of its cells contains more than 3 grains). 
 * When function is done the gird1 must be stable.
 * grid1 must be printed before each toppling round,
 * only if it is unstable.
 * 
 * @grid1: Left 3x3 grid of integers, with max 3 (stable)
 * @grid2: Right 3x3 grid of integers, with max 3 (stable)
 *
 * Return: void
