## 🧐 Project Description

In this project, we will implement a function in C to check if a singly linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

## 🧑🏼‍💻 Function Signature

```c
int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
```

## Input
head: A pointer to the head of the linked list.

## Output
Returns 1 if there is a cycle in the linked list.
Returns 0 otherwise.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
