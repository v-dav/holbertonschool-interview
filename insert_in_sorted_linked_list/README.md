## 🧐 Overview

This project focuses on implementing the algorithm for inserting elements into a sorted linked list using the C programming language. A sorted linked list maintains its elements in ascending or descending order, and the insertion algorithm ensures the proper placement of new elements while preserving the order.

## 🎓 Algorithm Details
The insertion algorithm for a sorted linked list typically involves traversing the list to find the correct position for the new element, then adjusting the pointers to insert it seamlessly. Understanding and implementing this algorithm is fundamental to mastering data structures and algorithms in C.
